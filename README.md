## VoteBot
VoteBot Node-based chatbot that interfaces with Slack, and provides an anonymous way for people to vote on presentations for the General Assembly WDI MiniConference. 

Unfortunately, because VoteBot was built quickly to meet a mini-hack deadline, it is hardcoded to talk only to our cohort Slack channel – so you can't try it out for yourself.

You can though have a look at the code – the most interesting parts, with the control flow and the responses, are in `lib/botsplease.js`

VoteBot was made over a few sessions of pair programming with myself and [Adrian Mancuso](https://github.com/adrianmancuso).
